# HaxeStdMacro
A haxe standard lib for macros. Intended specially as a learning curve for beginners and as means to do type instrospection at first.

This repo is created for 2 reasons:

1. Macros for Haxe is still black magic for most. The people that really understands how to use is usually related to the compiler in some way, so, their opinion about what it may be easy or not is very biased.

2. Doing basic macros is the building blocks for deep understanding, if you have any kind of way to cooperate with this project, do it, using only complex macros won't help a beginner.


Guides to add macros for this repository:

1. Describe step by step exactly what your macro is doing
2. Explain why some specific syntax is needed for applying the macro
3. Step by step process is preferred than doing things in a single big step. Unless shown that doing all in one way is more performant, we may create a compiler flag for using the optimized version and still maintain the beginner version one.
